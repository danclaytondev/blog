I'm a Research Software Engineer at the [STFC Hartree Centre](https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/), where I work on quite a varied range of projects.

My background is in Physics, I studied at the University of Liverpool.

## Tech Stack

I work with whatever tech stack is the most appropriate for a project with some core themes recently of:

- Full-stack apps
- Containerisation + cloud native development
- Data engineering + processing pipelines
- Applications of machine learning
