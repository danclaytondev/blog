I'm a Research Software Engineer at the [STFC Hartree Centre](https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/), where I work on quite a varied range of projects. I have spent a lot of time working recently in the life sciences domain, building software to support bioinformatics work and machine learning.

My background is in Physics (I studied at the University of Liverpool).

## Tech Stack

I work with whatever tech stack is the most appropriate for a project with some core themes recently of:

- Python and Typescript full-stack apps
- Containerisation
- Data engineering + processing pipelines
- PostgreSQL for relational databases
- Cloud deployment of containers (APIs etc), serverless functions
